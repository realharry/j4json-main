config file support?
including comments, etc. ???


[ Why j4json? ]

* flexible.
* different api. partial parsing/buidling
* building blocks. you can build your own json parser/builder.
* ..

e.g., 
(1) field type is int, but in json, use string.
    ( type=3 --> "google account", etc...)
(2) an object may need to be differntly serialized based on where it is used.
    e.g., if it's stand-alone, serialize one way,
          if it's a field of another object, serialize another way,...
(3) or, "depth" dependent
....

Another use case:

Json string payload.
Need to change one field. (string substitution?)
Or, even change some "leaf" objects, etc.
Old method: build a full object from the json string.
            Do modification.
            Build a new json string.
  
J4Json:   Build a partial object.
            do modification.
            Build a new json string.
